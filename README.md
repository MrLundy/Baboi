# Baboi
I still have an old printer with a Baboi board, and since efuntime stopped develpment in 2013 I am putting my version here.

I found the version I started with on a forum that isn't there anymore.

 Reprap firmware based on Sprinter
 Optimize for Sanguinololu 1.2 and above, RAMPS 
 Colin's build V10.1 for Prusa I3 running off of a Baboi Box.
 Chris's modification of Colin's build.
